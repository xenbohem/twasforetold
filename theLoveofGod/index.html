Lyrics:
whisper solemnly] Isaiah 53:3–5
[spoken word]
“He was despised and rejected by men… pierced for our transgressions… and by His wounds we are healed.”

[female opera voice] John 17
"he looked towards heaven and prayed."
[gothy distinguished poetic vocals soft and clear]
“Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you. 
For you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him.  
Now this is eternal life: 
that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.  
I have brought you glory on earth by finishing the work you gave me to do. And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you 
before the world began.
[epic electronic reverb and shofar] [pause for a moment-silence and reverence]
 “I have revealed you to those whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours; you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word'
"Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you."
"For I gave them the words you gave me and they accepted them. They knew with certainty that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me"
"I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, for they are yours."
"All I have is yours, and all you have is mine. And glory has come to me through them."
"I will remain in the world no longer, but they are still in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name, the name you gave me, so that they may be one as we are one."
"I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world.  My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one.  They are not of the world, even as I am not of it. Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth. As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world. For them I sanctify myself, that they too may be truly sanctified."

[whisper solemnly]  Romans 5:6–8
[spoken word narrated by distinguished male gothy vocals]
“While we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly… God demonstrates His own love for us in this: while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.”

[whisper solemnly] 1 John 4:9–10
[spoken word]

“This is how God showed His love among us: He sent His one and only Son into the world that we might live through Him. This is love: not that we loved God, but that He loved us…”

[whisper solemnly] John 3:16–17
[spoken word]
“For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him.”

[whisper solemnly]  Lamentations 3:22

“The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases; His mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning

I will declare your name to my people;
    in the assembly I will praise you.
You who fear the Lord, praise him!

    All you descendants of Jacob, honor him!
    Revere him, all you descendants of Israel!

For he has not despised or scorned
    the suffering of the afflicted one;
he has not hidden his face from him
    but has listened to his cry for help.

[angelic clear female vocals] From you comes the theme of my praise in the great assembly;
    before those who fear you I will fulfill my vows.
 The poor will eat and be satisfied;
    those who seek the Lord will praise him—
    may your hearts live forever!
[viking distinguished male vocals]
All the ends of the earth
    will remember and turn to the Lord,
and all the families of the nations
    will bow down before him,
for dominion belongs to the Lord
    and he rules over the nations.

All the rich of the earth will feast and worship;
    all who go down to the dust will kneel before him—
    those who cannot keep themselves alive.
Posterity will serve him;
    future generations will be told about the Lord.
They will proclaim his righteousness,
    declaring to a people yet unborn:
    He has done it!
[angelic soulful choir]
Hallelujah He Has Risen!  Lord of Lords King of Kings! Yeshua Jesus Christ is coming soon! [extreme bass dropped and cello reverb]
