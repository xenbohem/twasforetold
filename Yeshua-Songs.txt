Standing still in a place unknown , carrying a harp like a microphone, singing outloud til' my hearts content, Yeshua is my savior! Heaven Sent. Fields of wheat and shattered glass. At a moments notice my time will pass. Fleeting  time stands still. What's your will? Father God help me, I'm falling into the deep unknown,  Chimeras of wonder scientists have always known, the breeds they're creating can never be known, Father help us with this life in the Great Unknown.  Yeshua,Yeshua, guide us out of here. Yeshua, Yeshua, save us from this nightmare.  Cause time stands still yet moves so swiftly , beating hearts stand still for fear that 's coming... to this Earth.  Beat your drums for his return. Yell from the rooftops silence storm. Raise your hands and praise the Lord! Yeshua's here forever more! There's no turning back. 

Requiem feels , biblical lyre, frame drum heartbeat, Parisian café accordion, smooth tango rhythm, upright bass, mysterious lounge, mystical soft atmosphere,  soft  female vocals, tiptoe, Vampire. end
